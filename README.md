# Hermes Agent Railway Template

Deploy [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) on Railway using the official Nous Research image, dashboard, and s6 process supervision. A minimal compatibility entrypoint maps variables from existing template deployments before handing control to the upstream `/init` process.

## Railway configuration

The Dockerfile is pinned to this official image:

```text
nousresearch/hermes-agent:v2026.7.30@sha256:b869e64d6496d4763d5e4fb675b5f504cb23b0e35ec9b790481a56118602b10f
```

`v2026.7.30` is the currently reviewed production release. The tag and registry digest are both pinned; `latest` is never used.

Use these service settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Start command | `/usr/local/bin/hermes-railway-entrypoint gateway run` |
| Volume mount | `/data` |
| Public port | `3000` |
| Health-check path | `/api/status` |
| Replicas | `1` |

Railway continues building this GitHub repository so existing template consumers receive update notifications. The compatibility entrypoint only translates legacy environment variables, then executes the official image's `/init`; s6-overlay still supervises the Hermes gateway and dashboard.

### Variables

```dotenv
PORT=3000
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<required-secret>
```

The compatibility entrypoint maps the existing `ADMIN_USERNAME` and sealed `ADMIN_PASSWORD` values to the official dashboard variables before starting `/init`. Existing deployments therefore keep the same login without adding, copying, revealing, or re-entering credentials. It does not modify `config.yaml`. The service fails closed if no dashboard password is configured; credentials are never generated or printed in deployment logs.

For zero-interaction migration, a stable 32-byte dashboard session-signing secret is derived from `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Derivation supports legacy passwords shorter than Hermes's 16-byte minimum signing-key length while preserving the existing login. After migration, operators may add `HERMES_DASHBOARD_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` as an independent sealed value containing at least 32 random bytes. Rotating only this secret logs dashboard users out; it does not change the dashboard password or Hermes data. Neither the password nor the derived secret is written to `config.yaml`.

The Dockerfile supplies the remaining official variables:

```dotenv
HERMES_HOME=/data/.hermes
HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT=/data/.hermes
HERMES_LAZY_INSTALL_TARGET=/data/.hermes/lazy-packages
HERMES_DASHBOARD=1
HERMES_DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0
HERMES_GATEWAY_BOOTSTRAP_STATE=running
```

The entrypoint maps `PORT` to `HERMES_DASHBOARD_PORT` at runtime.

Provider credentials, messaging channels, models, skills, profiles, and gateway state are managed through the official dashboard and persisted under `/data/.hermes`.

## Upgrading Hermes

Update the pinned release and digest in `Dockerfile` through a pull request after reviewing the upstream [release notes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases) and validating the registry digest. Do not use `latest`. The validation workflow must pass before merging to the protected production branch.

See the official [Hermes Docker documentation](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/docker) for image behavior and configuration details.
